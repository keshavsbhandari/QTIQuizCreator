Objective:
Generate the MCQs in JSON format as mentioned below.

Generate a multiple-choice quiz based on
- The uploaded files.
- The quiz should assess foundational understanding of data structures as introduced in this document.

Inputs:
- Quiz Title: Unit-01: Data Structure Basics Quiz
- Quiz Description: This quiz assesses students' understanding of fundamental data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists.
- Number of Questions: 8

Scope:
- Limit all questions strictly to the content covered in the uploaded document.
- Focus on the following topics (if present):
  - Types and classifications of data structures
  - Linear vs. non-linear structures
  - Static vs. dynamic structures
  - Operations on structures (insert, delete, search, traverse)
  - Common use cases and real-world examples

Question Guidelines:
- Each question must have 4 options
- Exactly 1 correct answer per question (mark with "*" in output)
- Include brief explanation for all options (correct and incorrect)
- Distribute complexity as follows:
  - 3 Easy (recall-based)
  - 3 Moderate (conceptual understanding)
  - 2 Difficult (critical thinking or edge cases)

Output Format (JSON):
{
    "title": "Unit-01 Basics Quiz",
    "description": "A quiz to assess understanding of functions, organization, arrays, vectors, and comparisons in C++.",
    "questions": [
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is true about a function with arguments and no return type?",
            "options": [
                ["It does not accept input values.", "", "This is incorrect as it does accept input values."],
                ["It accepts input values but does not return any output.", "*", "Correct! This describes the function type."],
                ["It neither accepts input nor returns output.", "", "This describes a different type of function."],
                ["It accepts input and always returns a value.", "", "This is a different function type."]
            ]
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of inline functions?",
            "options": [
                ["They reduce function call overhead.", "*", "Correct! Inline functions avoid function call overhead."],
                ["They allow variable-length arguments.", "", "This is not related to inline functions."],
                ["They provide runtime polymorphism.", "", "This is achieved by virtual functions, not inline functions."],
                ["They execute slower than normal functions.", "", "Inline functions are generally faster."]
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Notes:
- Avoid repeating questions or options.
- Ensure a mix of fact-based and conceptual questions.
- Focus on clarity, accuracy, and alignment with the document.
